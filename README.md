A topic that can easily make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make them stick in to your<br> mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the <i>simplest</i> way possible.

Introduction
=================

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines on how to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

Wikipedia describes them as

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository contains the basic information and the code implementation of the commonly used design patterns so that the undertanding of the basic design patterns can become clear and easy to understand.

## Why Design Patterns?

1. Using a Design Pattern specific to any problem can improve the overall documentation and design of project.
2. Using a Design Pattern can help to build effective software with usability increased to many folds.

## What is Design Pattern?

Description of occurrence of a single problem again and again causing to design similar solution again gave rise to construction of design pattern.

## Components of Design Pattern

1. Name: The name of the Design Pattern includes the problem and it's solution.
2. Problem: What kind of problem the specific design pattern will solve.
3. Solution: What is the solution of specific problem.
4. Consequences: What will be the consequences in terms of space and time complexity etc.

‚ö†Ô∏è Be Careful
-----------------
- Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
- Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so. 
- Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems, not solutions **finding** problems; so don't overthink.
- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.

Follows the list of patterns separed by type:

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns are ones that create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly. This gives your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.

- **Abstract factory:** provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder:** separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
- **Factory method:** define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- **Prototype:** specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.
- **Singleton:** ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

### Structural Patterns
These concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- **Adapter:** allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
- **Bridge:** decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite:** composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
- **Decorator:** dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object.
- **Facade:** provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
- **Flyweight:** reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- **Proxy:** provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

### Behavioral Patterns
Most of these design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

- **Chain of responsibility:** delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
- **Command:** creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
- **Interpreter:** implements a specialized language.
- **Iterator:** accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator:** allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
- **Memento:** provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
- **Observer:** is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
- **State:** allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy:** allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
- **Template:** method defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
- **Visitor:** separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.

**LAB Assignments Document Files** <br>
This folder contains all Lab Assignments Word documents and theoretical solutions to the questions.

**LAB-1 Part-1** <br>
**Assignment Title: Lab-1 Part-1 Understanding OOP Concepts with Code Examples** <br>
In Lab-1 part-1, I have organized the code into separate packages, each dedicated to illustrating a specific Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept. These packages are designed to provide a clear and explicit understanding of various OOP concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more. Each package contains code implementations that exemplify the respective concept.

**LAB-1 Part-2** <br>
**Assignment Title: Lab-2 Part-2 Exploring Java Advance Concepts** <br>
The answers and implementation to the following questions:
1.	Overloading of the main method is possible or not?
2.	Can we create a program without the main method? How many main methods are allowed in Java Programs?
3.	What are the six ways to use this keyword?
4.	Prove that multiple inheritance is not supported in Java.
5.	How to override the static method?

**LAB-2 Part-1** <br>
**Assignment Title: Lab-2 part-1 Singleton Pattern Lab Work** <br>
I have done Examples and Lab Tasks of Lab-2 part-1.
To make the given example of SingeltonFA20Homework thread-safe, we can synchronize the getInstance() method. 
This will ensure that only one thread can access the instance of the Configuration class at a time.

**LAB-2 Part-2** <br>
**Assignment Title: Lab-2 part-2 Observer Pattern Lab Work** <br>
In this lab, I will implement all examples of the observer pattern that were mentioned in the lab tasks.<br>
**Question-1 Task:** <br>
In the first example, I have completed the lab task. Here are the steps I followed:
To convert the anonymous concrete observer into a proper concrete observer class, follow these steps:
‚Ä¢	Create a new class that implements the Observer interface.
‚Ä¢	Override the update method in the new class to specify how it should react to updates.
‚Ä¢	Instantiate the new observer class and add it to the EventSource <br>
**Question-2 Task:** <br>
To add the detach(Observer o) method to the Subject class and modify the pattern so that only active observers are notified, I can make the following changes:
1. Add the detach(Observer o) method to the Subject class to remove an observer from the list of observers.
2. Modify the notifyAllObservers() method to check if each observer is active before notifying it.

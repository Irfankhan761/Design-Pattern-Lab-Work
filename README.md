# Design-Pattern-Lab-Work
In this repository, I will be sharing all of my  design patterns lab work using java. Please feel free to explore my projects, code implementations, and design pattern examples. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
**LAB 1**
**Assignment Title: Lab1 Part1 Understanding OOP Concepts with Code Examples**

**Introduction**
In Lab 1, I have organized the code into separate packages, each dedicated to illustrating a specific Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept. These packages are designed to provide a clear 
and explicit understanding of various OOP concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more. Each package contains code implementations that exemplify the respective concept.

**Packages Overview**
Encapsulation
Package Name: EncapsulationConcepts
Description: This package focuses on the encapsulation concept in OOP. It includes code examples that demonstrate how encapsulation helps in data hiding and controlling access to class members.

Inheritance
Package Name: InheritanceConcepts
Description: In this package, you will find code that explores the inheritance concept in OOP. It showcases how classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, promoting code reusability.

Polymorphism
Package Name: PolymorphismConcepts
Description: The polymorphism package delves into the polymorphic behavior of objects in OOP. It illustrates how objects of different classes can respond to the same method differently.

Abstraction
Package Name: AbstractionConcepts
Description: Abstraction is a fundamental OOP concept. This package contains code that emphasizes the abstraction concept by simplifying complex systems into manageable components.

Interface Concepts
Package Name: InterfaceConcepts
Description: The InterfaceConcepts package explores the role of interfaces in OOP, promoting code consistency and flexibility.

**Usage:**
Each package within this repository contains its own set of code examples and explanations. You can explore these packages individually to gain a deeper understanding of the respective OOP concepts.

**Feedback**
Your feedback is valuable in further enhancing this repository's educational value. If you encounter any issues, have questions, or would like to suggest improvements, please feel free to open an issue or reach out via email.
